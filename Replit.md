# Host Katcord using Replit

Start by creating a bot at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)! Next, Go to [Replit](https://replit.com/) and create a profile if you haven't already! Then, click Create Repl and import the main.py file. From there click the plus and go to Secrets. Finally, create a new secret and in the first box put 'mydiscordtoken' and in the second box put your box token.

To copy the bot token go to the 'bot' tab and click 'reset token' then 'copy'!
